## What does it do?
Carry Helper does all sorts of things. It supports slayer and dungeon carries. For all carries, it lets the client leave a review for the carrier to give the carrier score in the official carrier discord. The carrier with the highest carry score at the end of each month gets 100,000,000 skyblock coins. It also shows the client where to stand to not get killed, both in slayer and dungeon carries. Along with this, it provides the carrier with stats about the clients HP, whether or not they are standing in the correct spot, their past reviews, and more. Overall, Carry Helper can help both carriers and clients be more efficient.
